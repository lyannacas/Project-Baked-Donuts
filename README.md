# Web Development - Project I

This repository was made for a web development project, a website mockup for a bakery store called Baked Donuts.
The name Baked Donuts came from when I first started learning web dev at freecodecamp.org, as of today, it still is my username there.
The initial idea for the Baked Donuts website can be found at https://codepen.io/lyannacas/full/VwbgxWg which is a landing page for a website that provided cooking tutorials and courses; the video shown there is where the name Baked Donuts and the idea for the site came from.
The project is an online store and was developed for the Web Development Course sponsored by the Instituto Nu through the e-learning platform Descomplica, with the purpose of practicing my skills in HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. The content of the website is in Brazilian Portuguese (pt-BR).
