# Web Development - Projects

This repository was made for a web development project, a website mockup for a bakery store called Baked Donuts.
The name Baked Donuts came from when I first started learning web dev at freecodecamp.org, as of today, it still is my username there.
The first idea for the Baked Donuts website can be found at https://codepen.io/lyannacas/full/VwbgxWg which was a landing page for a website that provided cooking tutorials and courses;
the video shown there is where the name Baked Donuts and the idea for the site came from.
